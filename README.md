## Problem 1

You only need to complete *one* of the following options.
However, if you submit both, we will use the answer with the higher score as your grade for this assignment.

We will provide snippets of simulated data for several detectors into which we will inject a few signals.
Your job is to write a search to detect these signals.

### Option 1

Write a matched filter search and use it to determine

  * the number of signals present
  * the physical amplitude, signal to noise ratio, and reference time for each detected signal

### Option 2

Write a maximum-likelihood search (does not assume the signal shape is known) and use it to determine

  * the number of signals present
  * the physical amplitude, maximized likelihood, and reference time for each detected signal
Something about alpha-lambda parametrization of common envelope evolution.
